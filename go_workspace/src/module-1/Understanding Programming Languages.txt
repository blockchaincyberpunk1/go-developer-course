Features: Dynamic typing, just-in-time compilation, and easy integration with other languages.
Use Cases: Commonly used in data science, machine learning, and scientific research.


Kotlin
History: Developed by JetBrains in 2011, Kotlin is a statically typed language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Features: Interoperability with Java, concise syntax, and null safety.
Use Cases: Kotlin is used in Android app development and server-side applications.


PHP
History: Created in the mid-1990s, PHP is a server-side scripting language for web development.
Features: Dynamic typing, easy integration with web servers, and vast ecosystem of libraries.
Use Cases: PHP powers many websites and web applications, especially in the early days of the web.


R
History: Developed in the early 1990s, R is a language designed for statistical computing and data analysis.
Features: Strong data analysis and visualization capabilities.
Use Cases: Widely used in data science, statistics, and bioinformatics.


Scala
History: Created in 2003, Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming concepts.
Features: Statically typed, expressive syntax, and compatibility with Java.
Use Cases: Scala is used in scalable and high-performance applications, often in combination with the Akka framework.


Python
History: Introduced in the late 1980s, Python is known for its readability and versatility.
Features: Dynamic typing, extensive standard library, and easy-to-learn syntax.
Use Cases: Python is used in web development, data science, automation, and more.


Java
History: Developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s, Java is a widely-used, platform-independent language.
Features: Strongly typed, object-oriented, and robust libraries.
Use Cases: Java is used in enterprise applications, Android app development, and large-scale systems.


JavaScript
History: Created by Netscape in the mid-1990s, JavaScript is a scripting language for web development.
Features: Dynamic typing, client-side web interactivity, and asynchronous programming.
Use Cases: JavaScript is essential for front-end web development and increasingly used for server-side development (Node.js).


TypeScript
History: Introduced by Microsoft in 2012, TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript.
Features: Static typing, improved tooling, and strong type inference.
Use Cases: TypeScript enhances JavaScript for large-scale applications and is widely used in modern web development.
