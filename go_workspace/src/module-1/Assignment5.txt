Mini Project - Basic Calculator

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to apply all the learned concepts in a mini-project by building a basic calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI).

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

a. Objective: Explain that the goal of this assignment is to challenge students to build a basic calculator application using Go and a graphical user interface (GUI) library.

b. Key Concepts: Highlight the key concepts students will apply: GUI development, event handling, functions, and arithmetic operations.

Task Description:

a. Calculator Application: Instruct students to develop a basic calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI). They can use a Go GUI library of their choice, such as Walk, for creating the GUI.

b. GUI Elements: The calculator should include the following GUI elements:

Display area for showing the input and result.
Buttons for digits (0-9).
Buttons for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
Equal (=) button for calculating and displaying the result.
Clear (C) button for clearing the input.
c. Event Handling: Students should implement event handlers for button clicks to update the display and perform calculations.

d. Arithmetic Operations: The calculator should support basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.

Sample Output:

Provide an example of how the calculator's GUI should look and behave. Include a sample calculation and the expected result.

Code Structure:

Instruct students to structure their code with clear comments explaining each section, including GUI setup, event handling, and calculation logic.

Testing:

a. User Interface Testing: Ensure that the GUI elements and buttons function as expected.

b. Calculation Testing: Encourage students to test the calculator with various arithmetic operations and numbers to verify accurate results.

Submission:

Instruct students to submit their Go calculator application code.

Grading Criteria: This assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

GUI Design: The completeness and user-friendliness of the GUI.
Event Handling: Correct implementation of event handlers for button clicks.
Arithmetic Operations: Accurate arithmetic calculations and results.
Code Structure: Readability and clarity of code structure and comments.
Testing: Thorough testing of the calculator's functionality.
