Variables and Data Types

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to help students practice variable declaration, initialization, and working with various data types in Go.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

a. Objective: Explain that the goal of this assignment is to reinforce students' understanding of variables and data types in Go.

b. Key Concepts: Emphasize that students will practice declaring variables, initializing them with values, performing operations, and displaying results.

Task Description:

a. Variable Declaration: Instruct students to declare variables of different data types, including integers, floats, and strings.

b. Variable Initialization: Have them initialize these variables with values of their choice.

c. Operations: Ask students to perform various operations using these variables. For example, they can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for numeric variables. For strings, they can concatenate them.

d. Display Results: Instruct students to print the results of these operations to the console.

Sample Output:

Provide an example of the expected output when the program is run with sample variable values.

Code Submission:

Instruct students to submit their Go program code that declares variables, initializes them, performs operations, and displays results.

Grading Criteria: This assignment can be graded based on correctness and completeness. Ensure that students have correctly declared variables, initialized them, performed operations accurately, and displayed the results.
