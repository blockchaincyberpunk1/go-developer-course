Communication with Channels

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to understand how to use channels for inter-goroutine communication.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

a. Objective: Explain that the goal of this assignment is to help students practice using channels for communication between goroutines, a fundamental concept in concurrent programming in Go.

b. Key Concepts: Emphasize the importance of channels for safe communication and synchronization between goroutines.

Task Description:

a. Message-Passing Scenario:

Instruct students to write a Go program that simulates a message-passing scenario between two goroutines.
One goroutine should send a message (a string) to the other goroutine using a channel.
The receiving goroutine should receive the message from the channel and display it.
b. Channel Creation:

Students should create a channel to facilitate communication between the two goroutines.
The channel should have an appropriate data type (e.g., chan string) to match the type of messages being sent.
c. Synchronization:

Emphasize the importance of synchronization to ensure that the sending and receiving goroutines execute in the correct order.
Students should use the channel's capabilities for synchronization.
Testing:

a. Test Scenarios: Instruct students to test their program with different messages to ensure that the message-passing works correctly.

b. Edge Cases: Encourage students to consider edge cases, such as sending empty messages or handling situations where the receiving goroutine expects a message but none is sent.

Code Submission:

Instruct students to submit the Go program (main.go) that simulates the message-passing scenario using channels. They should include comments to explain their code and the logic behind channel creation and synchronization.

Grading Criteria: This assignment can be graded based on the correctness of the message-passing scenario, the effective use of channels for communication, proper synchronization, and the accuracy of the displayed messages. Ensure that students correctly create channels and implement goroutines for message passing.
