In this step-by-step guide, I'll walk you through writing comprehensive tests for a Go package containing multiple functions. We'll use a simplified example to demonstrate various types of tests, including unit tests and table-driven tests.

Step 1: Understand the Provided Go Package
Begin by understanding the Go package you need to test. In this example, we'll create a package named mathutil that contains several mathematical utility functions.
go
Copy code
// mathutil.go
package mathutil

// Function to add two integers.
func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// Function to subtract two integers.
func Subtract(a, b int) int {
    return a - b
}
Step 2: Create the Test File
Create a test file named mathutil_test.go in the same directory as your main code (mathutil.go).
go
Copy code
// mathutil_test.go
package mathutil

import "testing"
Step 3: Write Unit Tests
Create separate test functions for each function in the mathutil package (Add and Subtract).
go
Copy code
func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    result := Add(2, 3)
    expected := 5
    if result != expected {
        t.Errorf("Add(2, 3) returned %d, expected %d", result, expected)
    }
}

func TestSubtract(t *testing.T) {
    result := Subtract(5, 2)
    expected := 3
    if result != expected {
        t.Errorf("Subtract(5, 2) returned %d, expected %d", result, expected)
    }
}
Step 4: Write Table-Driven Tests
Create a table-driven test for the Add function to cover multiple input scenarios.
go
Copy code
func TestAddTableDriven(t *testing.T) {
    testCases := []struct {
        a, b     int
        expected int
    }{
        {2, 3, 5},
        {0, 0, 0},
        {-1, 1, 0},
        {10, -5, 5},
    }

    for _, tc := range testCases {
        result := Add(tc.a, tc.b)
        if result != tc.expected {
            t.Errorf("Add(%d, %d) returned %d, expected %d", tc.a, tc.b, result, tc.expected)
        }
    }
}
Step 5: Run the Tests
Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the tests using the go test command.

bash
Copy code
go test
This command will execute your test functions and report the results.

Step 6: Documentation
Document your test file, explaining how you've written tests for all functions in the mathutil package, including unit tests and table-driven tests.
Step 7: Submission
Submit your test file along with any documentation related to your testing approach.
By following these steps, you've successfully written comprehensive tests for a Go package containing multiple functions. This approach covers different types of tests, including unit tests and table-driven tests, to ensure thorough coverage of your code.
