Certainly! In this walkthrough, I'll guide you through implementing the core functionality of your CLI application based on your CLI application plan. We'll continue with the example of a task management CLI application that allows users to add, list, mark tasks as done, and delete tasks. You should have already completed Homework 1 (CLI Application Planning) and Homework 2 (Command-Line Flags and Arguments). Now, let's proceed with the core functionality implementation with detailed comments:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
)

type Task struct {
	ID          int
	Description string
	Done        bool
}

var tasks []Task

func main() {
	addFlag := flag.String("add", "", "Add a new task")
	listFlag := flag.Bool("list", false, "List all tasks")
	doneFlag := flag.Int("done", -1, "Mark a task as done by ID")
	deleteFlag := flag.Int("delete", -1, "Delete a task by ID")

	flag.Parse()

	if *listFlag {
		listTasks()
	} else if *addFlag != "" {
		addTask(*addFlag)
	} else if *doneFlag != -1 {
		markTaskAsDone(*doneFlag)
	} else if *deleteFlag != -1 {
		deleteTask(*deleteFlag)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Usage: task-cli [options]")
		flag.PrintDefaults()
	}
}

func addTask(description string) {
	task := Task{ID: len(tasks) + 1, Description: description}
	tasks = append(tasks, task)
	fmt.Printf("Task added: %s\n", description)
}

func listTasks() {
	fmt.Println("Tasks:")
	for _, task := range tasks {
		status := "Incomplete"
		if task.Done {
			status = "Done"
		}
		fmt.Printf("%d. %s (%s)\n", task.ID, task.Description, status)
	}
}

func markTaskAsDone(taskID int) {
	if taskID <= 0 || taskID > len(tasks) {
		fmt.Println("Invalid task ID")
		return
	}

	tasks[taskID-1].Done = true
	fmt.Printf("Task marked as done: %s\n", tasks[taskID-1].Description)
}

func deleteTask(taskID int) {
	if taskID <= 0 || taskID > len(tasks) {
		fmt.Println("Invalid task ID")
		return
	}

	deletedTask := tasks[taskID-1]
	tasks = append(tasks[:taskID-1], tasks[taskID:]...)
	fmt.Printf("Task deleted: %s\n", deletedTask.Description)
}
Here's the code breakdown with detailed comments:

We start with the same Task struct and tasks slice for task management.

In the main function, we have already defined command-line flags and parsed them using the flag package, as shown in Homework 2.

We implement the core functionality in separate functions:

addTask: Adds a new task with a description to the tasks slice and increments the task ID.
listTasks: Lists all tasks, showing their IDs, descriptions, and completion status.
markTaskAsDone: Marks a task as done by changing the Done field to true.
deleteTask: Deletes a task by removing it from the tasks slice.
We check the provided flags in the main function, and based on the flag, we call the corresponding function to perform the task.

We also provide usage instructions if no valid flag or argument is provided.

Now, you have a complete Go CLI application for task management with the core functionality implemented. You can compile and run this application to manage your tasks from the command line.
