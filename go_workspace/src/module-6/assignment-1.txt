Certainly! In this walkthrough, I'll guide you through the process of planning a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application in Go, and I'll provide detailed comments for each step. For the sake of this exercise, let's plan a simple task management CLI application.

Step 1: Define the Purpose and Use Case

Use Case: Task Management CLI Application

Description:
Our CLI application aims to help users manage their tasks and to-do lists from the command line. Users can create, list, update, and delete tasks using various commands.

Key Features:
1. Create a new task
2. List all tasks
3. Update the status of a task (e.g., mark as done)
4. Delete a task

User Interactions:
- To create a new task: 
  $ task-cli add "Buy groceries"

- To list all tasks:
  $ task-cli list

- To mark a task as done:
  $ task-cli done <taskID>

- To delete a task:
  $ task-cli delete <taskID>
Step 2: Define Commands and Subcommands

Now, let's define the commands and subcommands that our CLI application will support:

add: This command will allow users to add a new task.
list: This command will list all tasks.
done: This subcommand will mark a task as done.
delete: This subcommand will delete a task.

Command Structure:

task-cli <command> [flags/arguments]

Available Commands:
- add <taskDescription>: Create a new task
- list: List all tasks
- done <taskID>: Mark a task as done
- delete <taskID>: Delete a task

Flags/Arguments:
- <taskDescription>: Description of the task to be added
- <taskID>: ID of the task to be marked as done or deleted
Step 3: Specify Expected Behavior

For each command or subcommand, specify the expected behavior and output:

add: Creates a new task with the provided description and adds it to the task list. The user receives a confirmation message.

list: Lists all tasks with their IDs and descriptions.

done: Marks a task with the given ID as "done" and displays a confirmation message.

delete: Deletes a task with the given ID and displays a confirmation message.

Command Behavior:

- add <taskDescription>:
  - Create a new task with <taskDescription>
  - Add the task to the task list
  - Display a confirmation message like "Task added: Buy groceries"

- list:
  - List all tasks with their IDs and descriptions
  - Display tasks in a readable format, e.g., "1. Buy groceries (Incomplete)"

- done <taskID>:
  - Mark the task with <taskID> as "done"
  - Display a confirmation message like "Task marked as done: Buy groceries"

- delete <taskID>:
  - Delete the task with <taskID>
  - Display a confirmation message like "Task deleted: Buy groceries"
Step 4: Consider Error Handling

Consider scenarios where errors might occur, and plan for user-friendly error messages. For example:

If a user attempts to mark a non-existent task as "done," display an error message like "Task not found."

If a user provides an invalid command or subcommand, display a usage guide with available commands.

Step 5: Document the Plan

Document the CLI application plan in a clear and organized manner, including the use case, key features, user interactions, and expected behavior for each command. This documentation will serve as a reference during the implementation phase.

That's it! You have successfully planned a CLI application in Go for task management. This planning phase is crucial before you start coding, as it helps you define the scope and requirements of your application. You can now proceed with the implementation of your CLI application based on this plan.
